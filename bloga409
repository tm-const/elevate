<p class="">Everyone knows that product reviews are at the core of Amazon’s secret sauce as a marketplace. Sellers have gone above and beyond in trying to prop up their products while still remaining within (and often without) the Amazon Guidelines and Terms of Service. As Amazon has been trying to navigate this Black Hat storm, they’ve added another aspect to product reviews that have inadvertently made it even more difficult for Amazon Sellers.&nbsp;</p><h2>Ratings vs Reviews</h2><p class="">What you will often notice while shopping on Amazon is that next to the star rating on the listing, it no longer says “Reviews” and is replaced by “Ratings”. What this means is that Amazon customers are no longer required to leave a description when leaving feedback on a product, and can instead just give their purchase a star rating. In short, if there is a description: Review. If not: Rating.&nbsp;</p><h2>What This Means for Sellers</h2><p class="">The trouble with ratings comes in a couple of different forms. The first is that ratings do not show in any of the Seller Central review dashboards, and you often cannot tag a date to when the rating was left on your product unless you are tracking it daily either manually or with software support (which many software tools still do not catch).&nbsp;</p><p class="">The second and often larger issue is that there is no way of getting any information about who left the rating. This causes problems if you want to identify a customer to link the rating to in an effort to reach out and resolve a problem. It also makes it especially difficult to identify if it is even a legitimate rating in the first place. Some sellers have even claimed a sudden drop in average star rating due to a number of low ratings coming in all at once, leading many to think this is a new method of competitor sabotage.&nbsp;</p><p class="">As of now, Amazon does not seem to be lending any solutions to these problems, but we don’t expect ratings to be going anywhere, anytime soon. Although if you do notice any suspicious activity on your account, it will be best if you have some historical information that you have tracked ready at hand, and then you can only hope that Amazon’s Seller Support will have a little more insight to help you (big emphasis on hope).</p>]]></content:encoded><media:content type="image/jpeg" url="https://images.squarespace-cdn.com/content/v1/5ce1bdd676dcc3000111bd0a/1598036176744-ZE6FOP4W85F5JO7MDV5V/ke17ZwdGBToddI8pDm48kLkXF2pIyv_F2eUT9F60jBl7gQa3H78H3Y0txjaiv_0fDoOvxcdMmMKkDsyUqMSsMWxHk725yiiHCCLfrh8O1z4YTzHvnKhyp6Da-NYroOW3ZGjoBKy3azqku80C789l0iyqMbMesKd95J-X4EagrgU9L3Sa3U8cogeb0tjXbfawd0urKshkc5MgdBeJmALQKw/christian-wiediger-rymh7EZPqRs-unsplash.jpg?format=1500w" medium="image" isDefault="true" width="1500" height="1000"><media:title type="plain">Amazon Ratings vs Reviews</media:title></media:content></item><item><title>Amazon Can Be Held Liable - What This Means To You</title><dc:creator>Blake P.</dc:creator><pubDate>Thu, 03 Sep 2020 16:23:14 +0000</pubDate><link>https://www.elevategrowthgroup.com/blog/amazon-can-be-held-liable-what-this-means-to-you</link><guid isPermaLink="false">5ce1bdd676dcc3000111bd0a:5d1bb1c94942c60001babb81:5f3ea37749d2fe5afd12bddf</guid><description><![CDATA[Under section 6.1 is a subsection saying that you will defend, indemnify,

This agreement called the “Amazon Services Business Solutions Agreement,” is a short agreement often perused over or a box quickly checked but it contains a few key points of information all sellers should be aware of. It gives Amazon complete and near unilateral control of the sellers that use its third-party marketplace. It controls your data, your terminations, your enrollment, most importantly, and not to be forgotten your indemnification.</p><p class="">Under section 6.1 is a subsection saying that you will defend, indemnify, and hold harmless Amazon against any claims or losses. The short version, if sued you will take the brunt of any costs or punishment. Amazon could not be held liable for any actions or situations between a marketplace seller and a buyer. Should you choose to not indemnify Amazon in an expeditious manner, you will find your account under suspension until doing so. As well, Amazon will retain legal counsel and pass those charges along to you.</p><p class="">In previous cases and situations, Amazon’s stance has been that transactions between buyers and sellers are to be worked out between those parties and that Amazon merely provides the platform in which they do business. A 2019 trial court ruling agreed to this, but this is 2020 and as of the most recent appeals court ruling this has been overturned. Amazon is on the hook as well now, and that should make your eyebrow raise.&nbsp;</p><p class="">Most sellers skip over the Business Solutions Agreement, we all know we really are selling our soul and virtues when we sign up for the platform there’s no need to be reminded of this in a long written legal fashion. Handing over valuable brand and product data and diving into the murky fight for millions of dollars of potential sales on a daily basis. But what a lot of sellers miss out on and skimp over is actually section 9 of this agreement simply titled “Insurance.”</p><p class="">Section 9 says if your gross proceeds from Your Transactions exceed the insurance threshold during each month over any period of 3 consecutive months, OR if requested by us, then within 30 days you will maintain and provide Amazon with record commercial liability insurance with Amazon as an additional coinsured.&nbsp;</p><p class="">Why is this important all of a sudden you ask, it’s been around for years and years and no ones asked for it? They don’t make you upload it! “I’ve never been sued”, or at least you don’t plan on it. This is important because legally (and please refer to the experts) in the past Amazon was NOT a responsible party, you were. They held you under lock and key with that beautiful Seller Central account. Play by our rules and you can live another day. Now that Amazon is found to be held liable for products on its marketplace you can expect a whole new slew of rulings and proceedings.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="">Here’s where we can expect this to go in a few different ways. Mind you, this is no legal opinion and you should proceed with caution or consult your own legal counsel. This is merely speculation and first hand experience when dealing with Amazon in this arena.&nbsp;</p><p class="">If this ruling stands and is enforced and Amazon is in fact responsible for products sold on its marketplace I very much expect a wave of changes coming to the platform highlighted in no particular order below:</p><p data-rte-preserve-empty="true" class=""></p><ul data-rte-list="default"><li><p class="">Requirement of commercial liability insurance posted within the account in an upload portal. This is pretty basic, Amazon wants to make sure that Sellers and ultimately themselves are covered by the rules they are already “applying.”</p></li><li><p class="">A crackdown on products with safety issues. This will be vital for both the counterfeit and safety complaints. Expect more products to come under additional scrutiny from Amazon.</p></li><li><p class="">Some categories/product offerings being taken down. Simply put, I could see some markets disappearing off of Amazon and moving into the restricted products section. There’s a lot to police and Amazon is only so big. This is a big extreme but the weight of litigation could weigh heavy here especially with Amazon under a very big microscope from an investigative and antitrust perspective.</p></li></ul><p class="">To wrap up, I would keep a keen eye on this development and make sure you have your ducks in a row when it comes to insurance and product compliance. Whether it’s specific tests, documents, MSDS sheets or the like having everything you can should amazon request it will be immensely helpful to stay above water within Amazon’s ocean.</p><p class=""><br><br><br></p>]]></content:encoded><media:content type="image/png" url="https://images.squarespace-cdn.com/content/v1/5ce1bdd676dcc3000111bd0a/1599149871878-BW4XZZHCPZZZ1EY30HIH/ke17ZwdGBToddI8pDm48kEl1DsHeG9JOaEhMaJL_Cs4UqsxRUqqbr1mOJYKfIPR7LoDQ9mXPOjoJoqy81S2I8N_N4V1vUb5AoIIIbLZhVYxCRW4BPu10St3TBAUQYVKcvlxkVLLnQAQCO4ZmlQ0esA2w3S6MYzxt5sDFWiZNnLXxR_ES0UAM4sT-iacaUolt/Screen+Shot+2020-09-03+at+9.17.37+AM.png?format=1500w" medium="image" isDefault="true" width="1098" height="634"><media:title type="plain">Amazon Can Be Held Liable - What This Means To You</media:title></media:content></item><item><title>When a $15k Mistake Turns Into a $1M Mistake (A Cautionary Tale)</title><dc:creator>Emily Wilcox</dc:creator><pubDate>Wed, 26 Aug 2020 22:08:27 +0000</pubDate><link>https://www.elevategrowthgroup.com/blog/when-a-15k-mistake-turns-into-a-1m-mistake-a-cautionary-tale</link><guid isPermaLink="false">5ce1bdd676dcc3000111bd0a:5d1bb1c94942c60001babb81:5f3d9ee3f4d0c03ba98183ee</guid><description><![CDATA[Don’t let the mistakes of the past prevent you from making clear-headed

He does about $62,000 per month in gross revenue on Amazon. And he does that&nbsp;<em>without advertising</em>.&nbsp;</p><p class="">He wants to grow the business to $200k/month so he can spend a little less time working and get into a better balance with his family.&nbsp;</p><p class="">When I asked him why he’s not doing any advertising, he said it was because two years ago he hired an agency to run some Google Ads for him and it was a disaster that cost him about $15,000. He had such a bad taste in his mouth, he stopped advertising altogether.</p><p class="">Sooooo, here’s where things get a little crazy. I can say <strong>for certain</strong> that his brand should be doing at least $100k/month. But he’s not—he’s doing $62k. So every month, he’s leaving ~$40k on the table. Why? Because some bozo that runs Google Ads wasted his money.&nbsp;</p><p class="">Now look, I don’t like losing money any more than the next guy/gal. But get in a room full of business owners and ask for a show of hands on who has been burned by a bad agency or bad employee. Guaranteed the room will look like this:</p>

<p class="">It’s just part of doing business.&nbsp;</p><p class="">This guy basically had two choices:</p><p class=""><strong>Option A:</strong> Lick his wounds, feel sorry about losing $15k, let it be a lesson that makes him a little wiser &amp; smarter next go-round, and move on.</p><p class="">-or-</p><p class=""><strong>Option B:</strong> Feel so burned by the $15k loss that he decides not to advertise, even on other channels. Because of that, he leaves $40k per month on the table for two years. Now let’s do the math on how much this mistake actually cost him.</p><p class="">$15,000 + ($40,000*24)= $975,000</p><p class="">He took Option B, and that $15k mistake is now a $975k mistake (given it another month and it’ll be a cool $1M.)</p><p class="">Most of us logical folks would choose Option A. Or at least we think we would. You see, it’s very easy when you have the perspective and detachment of it not actually being your $15k that was lost. I’m currently reading the business book “The Obstacle is the Way” and it’s full of examples, historic and contemporary, of business idols who were hit with major adversity and used it as fuel to build their empire.&nbsp;</p><p class="">Don’t let the mistakes of the past prevent you from making clear-headed decisions in the present. Go forth and prosper. Build your empire. Hire the agency. Try the ads again.

<p class="">Prime Day 2020 has come with many changes, and we aren’t totally in the clear just yet. What is usually the biggest sales event of the year, Prime Day typically falls around mid-July to pick up the slower summer sales months. Last we heard, the “leaked” Prime Day date was set for October 5th, but it seems there is more to be considered before we save the date.&nbsp;</p><h2><strong>What Sellers Need to Know</strong></h2><p class="">Not only is this year set to be the biggest Q4 on Amazon to date, but there are some additional obstacles that Amazon has placed on sellers in the form of FBA inventory limits, and ambiguity in sale dates. As the USPS has shown to be unreliable as of late (and doesn’t look promising moving forward), this could catch sellers in a tough spot with unexpected sales surges and navigating FBM fulfilment within Amazon’s shipping requirements.&nbsp;</p><p class="">Amazon has rumoured sale events around October 15th and running through the end of the month as a “Holiday Sale”.&nbsp; Could this mean an additional sale between Prime Day and Black Friday/Cyber Monday, or could this be a tentative sale for the actual Prime Day sale? Amazon has now put some of their own devices on sale, which is typically reserved for Prime Day. Between this and all the strain on fulfillment, it could mean that Prime Day could be skipped over all together this year. At any rate, sellers will need to stay on their toes this Q4.&nbsp;</p><p class=""><br></p>]]></content:encoded><media:content type="image/jpeg" url="https://images.squarespace-cdn.com/content/v1/5ce1bdd676dcc3000111bd0a/1598035998357-1WO9764GYP72SCICBKDX/ke17ZwdGBToddI8pDm48kHhmgF6rHP5KIHB3xa-m0WdZw-zPPgdn4jUwVcJE1ZvWQUxwkmyExglNqGp0IvTJZamWLI2zvYWH8K3-s_4yszcp2ryTI0HqTOaaUohrI8PIUUCXNDMEcyVw064uVae-9SGYNpbxH8yJSXiap4Z3jXYKMshLAGzx4R3EDFOm1kBS/amazonprime-943x640.jpg?format=1500w" medium="image" isDefault="true" width="943" height="640"><media:title type="plain">The Latest on Amazon Prime Day 2020</media:title></media:content></item><item><title>FBA &amp; FBM: Which Fulfillment Method is Right for Your Brand? </title><dc:creator>Eva Hart</dc:creator><pubDate>Wed, 12 Aug 2020 15:11:00 +0000</pubDate><link>https://www.elevategrowthgroup.com/blog/fba-vs-fbm-which-one-is-right-for-your-brand</link><guid isPermaLink="false">5ce1bdd676dcc3000111bd0a:5d1bb1c94942c60001babb81:5f1763fe4ad0d119565f9b2e</guid><description><![CDATA[When you set up your Amazon Seller Central Account you can register for

Depending on your business structure and your goals one of these fulfillment options might be the best for your brand, in some cases, you may opt to use both FBA and FBM. </p><p class="">It is important to know the differences between these two fulfillment methods so that you can choose the one that aligns with your needs. Keep reading for more details on Amazon’s fulfillment options, FBA and FBM!</p><h1><strong>Fulfillment by Amazon</strong></h1><p class="">Fulfillment by Amazon otherwise known as FBA is an Amazon fulfillment method in which you store your products in Amazon’s fulfillment centers. Amazon then picks, packs, and ships your products directly to the customer.</p><h2><strong>Benefits of FBA</strong></h2><ol data-rte-list="default"><li><p class="">Prime-eligibility: Prime allows you to offer your customers free same-day, one-day and two-day shipping. Many shoppers filter for Prime products because they trust the shipping and return methods that Amazon provides.</p></li><li><p class="">FBA Subscribe and Save: This program enables you to sell eligible products to customers on a subscription basis at a discount of 5%, 10%, 15%, or 20%, and with free shipping. Subscribe and Save allows customers to select the product, quantity, and frequency of delivery.</p></li><li><p class="">Returns and Customer Service: Amazon handles customer care and all returns on FBA orders. This provides a more “hands-off” experience for you and your team as you will not need to process returns and speak with the customers.</p></li><li><p class="">Scaling Inventory: FBA provides flexibility allowing you to send large quantities of products at once or small quantities of inventory into their fulfillment center. This flexibility is useful when you are entering a new marketplace and plan to send a small sample shipment. Or during busy times of the year, such as the holiday season, when you need to double or triple your inventory.</p></li></ol><h1><strong>Fulfillment by Merchant</strong></h1><p class="">Fulfillment by Merchant otherwise known as FBM is designed for brands and retailers seeking to maintain more control over their inventory and fulfill Amazon orders themselves. This means you will store products in your own warehouse or facility, then pick, pack, and ship the product to the customer on your own. You will also process returns and provide customer service for your orders.</p><p class="">The biggest drawback of FBM is the lack of exposure to Prime members, as these listings will not have the Prime badge.</p><h2><strong>Benefits of FBM</strong></h2><ol data-rte-list="default"><li><p class="">Increased Control: FBM allows you to control your inventory, shipping and handling, packaging, delivery speed, and shipping carriers. You also maintain control of return methods and the customer service experience.</p></li><li><p class="">Greater Margins: You can explore various options to cover your fulfillment costs and are not bound by FBA’s non-negotiable fulfillment and storage fees.</p></li><li><p class="">Building Your Brand: It is more feasible with FBM to build an independent brand because you have more ownership over your relationship with customers.</p></li><li><p class="">Multi-channel Fulfillment: Once you find a fulfillment model that works for your business, you can use this strategy across all of your marketplaces rather than having different means of fulfillment for off-channel processing.</p></li></ol><p class=""><br></p>

<h2><strong>Adding FBM Offer to Listings</strong></h2><p class="">Many brands are adding FBM as an option on their listings along with FBA while Amazon’s shipping times are delayed due to COVID-19. Before you do this please make sure you have enough inventory outside of Amazon and have an efficient fulfillment process.&nbsp; You can follow the steps below to add FBM as an option on your listings. This process needs to be done for each product one by one.</p><ol data-rte-list="default"><li><p class="">Find the product in manage inventory</p></li><li><p class="">Click the dropdown on the right side of the page</p></li><li><p class="">Select "Add another condition"</p></li><li><p class="">Enter SKU, Condition, Price, Quantity, Set fulfillment channel to "I will ship this item myself". Make sure FBM SKU is different than FBA SKU.</p></li><li><p class="">Save and finish. You’re done!</p></li></ol><p class=""><br>It’s critical that you choose a fulfillment strategy that is specific to your goals on the Amazon channel.

<figure class="block-animation-none">

    <span>&#147;</span>On January 31, 2020, the UK left the EU and entered a transition period where existing arrangements are being kept in place until December 31, 2020. The UK is due to formally leave the EU’s Single Market and Customs Union from January 1, 2021.<br/><br/>While UK-EU negotiations are ongoing (including determining what tariffs, if any, will apply), from January 1, 2021 there will be a customs border between the UK and EU which will have an impact on businesses working across this border.<br/><br/>This will have the following impact for Amazon Selling Partners from January 1, 2021:<br/><br/>FBA offers using EFN will not be fulfilled across the UK-EU border.<br/><br/>Pan-European FBA inventory transfers will stop between the UK and EU (however, Pan-European FBA will continue to transfer inventory within the EU region, supporting your sales on Germany, France, Italy and Spain sites)<br/><br/>To mitigate the impact of these changes, you should consider splitting your inventory and sending it to a fulfillment centre in the UK and the EU, so that you have sufficient stock either side of the new customs border<br/>This may require you to ship your products across the new UK-EU customs border and provide additional information as part of a customs declaration <br/><br/>Your Amazon business will continue to operate as usual until January 1, 2021. However, there are actions you can start taking now to prepare your business for the new customs borders. For information about how you can prepare for these changes, and for all of the latest information about Brexit, please see our BREXIT guidance help pages and the UK government website.<br/><br/>Thank you for selling on Amazon. We remain committed to supporting your business selling in the UK and in the EU as we make this transition, and we will continue to provide the latest information to support you and help your business thrive in the future.<span>&#148;</span>

<p class="">If you are Brand Registered on Amazon then you have access to a suite of features that other Amazon sellers don’t have access to.  Amazon stays consistent with releasing new tools and features for their registered brands. Earlier this year they released A/B testing that allows you to test two versions of Enhanced Brand Content (EBC) on one listing to see which one has a higher conversion rate. </p><p class="">Brand registry is an important step for any brand who wants to increase their presence on Amazon and stand out among their competitors. Some of the benefits of brand registry include:</p><ol data-rte-list="default"><li><p class="">More control over Amazon product pages that use your brand name, so customers are more likely to see the correct information associated with your brand</p></li><li><p class="">Powerful search and report tools that simplify the process of finding cases of potential infringement&nbsp;</p></li><li><p class="">Brand registry support that includes a global team that is available 24/7 for any questions you might have</p></li><li><p class="">Brand building features such as A+ Content, EBC, A/B Testing, Stores, Sponsored Brands, Brand Analytics and the Brand Dashboard</p></li></ol><p class="">Amazon recently added to the list above when they released the Brand Story feature that can be found under the A+ Content Manager. First, I’ll talk about why this feature is a benefit your brand should be taking advantage of right away! Then, I’ll explain how to access and submit your Brand Story if you are brand registered. </p><h1>Why Your Brand Story is Important </h1><p class="">Every brand has a story that makes them unique and sets them apart from their competitors. Here at Elevate, we have always stressed the importance of Amazon Sellers telling the story of their brand to shoppers to increase trust, awareness, and brand loyalty. There are many benefits of showing your customers who you are and why your brand is different. </p><h2>Benefits of Story Telling</h2><ol data-rte-list="default"><li><p class="">Storytelling Humanizes Your Brand: People relate to other people, not products or big companies. Sharing your brand story is the best way to reveal the people behind the company, demonstrate transparency, and cultivate authentic relationships with your customers. </p></li><li><p class="">Storytelling Shows Your Heart: Behind every Amazon Seller is a person or group of people who started a company with a purpose, vision, mission, and set of values. Telling your brand story allows shoppers to see the heart behind the products which can create brand loyalty. If a customer relates to your brand mission they will be more likely to continue to purchase your products in the future and better yet tell their friends about you! </p></li><li><p class="">Storytelling Sets You Apart: What makes you unique? Is it your product design? Is it your customer service? Is your company family-owned, veteran-owned, female-owned, or any other type of ownership that sets you apart?  You are different from your competitors and shoppers want to know why! </p></li></ol><p class="">Amazon has just made it easier than ever to tell your Brand Story and show shoppers why they should purchase from your brand! Before the release of the Brand Story feature, Amazon Sellers had to use precious space on their EBC, which meant one less module to use for product description. </p><p class="">Now you can use all of your EBC modules to display the variety of products you offer through comparison charts and call out the many features of your products through images and descriptions. Read below for step by step instructions on adding your Brand Story!</p><h1>How to Add Your Brand Story </h1><p class="">Adding your Brand Story is a quick and easy process. Follow the steps below to start yours today!</p><ol data-rte-list="default"><li><p class="">Log into your Seller Central Account and select “A+ Content Manager” </p></li></ol>

In the smaller image spot, you should add your logo. </p><p class="">          You’ll notice that both image spots ask for two different images. This is because one will be used <br>          when customers are viewing your Brand Story via a mobile device and the other is for customers on <br>          a desktop/laptop. Make sure to properly size each high-resolution image according to the size <br>          requirements. </p>

<p class="">Inventory restrictions - Amazon has new policies regarding the quantity that sellers can ship in for inventory - and it will be in effect until at least the end of this year. For most sellers (and most products that have a history of already being sold on Amazon) we are seeing it amount to about 3 months worth of stock. For new products just launching, it looks to be a 200 unit max. As you may have guessed, this means that 3PL providers will play a huge role this holiday season. If you haven’t already done so, you should definitely get a 3rd party fulfillment option setup. We highly recommend <a href="https://itbfulfillment.com/">ITB Fulfillment</a> as a great solution! </p>

<p class="">Walmart brick and mortar to be closed Thanksgiving day - Walmart announced this week that it will close all retail locations for Thanksgiving Day, including Sam’s Club brick and mortars. They will be open the Wednesday before TG, but have not yet made a decision for Black Friday.&nbsp; </p>

<p class="">Prime Day &amp; Q4 - As I’m sure most of you are aware, Amazon has postponed Prime Day. Our sources are telling us that it’s tentatively scheduled for October. This means that Q4 is going to be BANANAS! The good news is that most sellers will smash previous Q4 sales records, the bad news is that inventory restrictions are going to make it a tightrope act. </p>

In order to maintain your SFP status, you will need a solid fulfillment process that includes picking, packing, and shipping the product the same day as the order is made.&nbsp;You must also guarantee delivery within two days, at no extra cost to the buyer. </p><h1>Benefits of SFP</h1><p class="">The main benefit of SFP is the Prime badge that will display on your Product Detail Page. Prime products rank better than non-Prime products because Amazon&nbsp;prioritizes fast shipping. Along with better ranking comes more sales and higher conversions, which can help you own the Buy Box. </p><p class="">Many Amazon shoppers solely purchase Prime products because they know they can trust the high standard of shipping, returns, and customer service associated with Prime. Consumers can filter their search for Prime products which means Prime Sellers will have less competition in the Prime-filtered search results. It has become increasingly important to offer reliable shipping and one way to let customers know they can trust your brand is via that coveted Prime badge. </p><p class=""><br></p>

The Prime badge will not be displayed on items enrolled in Seller Fulfilled Prime during the trial period, however, you must process the orders with a zero-day handling time (meaning the product needs to ship the day it is ordered). Once you successfully complete the trial period, you will automatically be enrolled in Seller Fulfilled Prime and your enrolled ASINs will display the Prime badge to customers.</p><p class=""><br></p><h1>Losing SFP Privileges</h1><p class="">Amazon can revoke your SFP status if you don’t consistently hit your delivery target dates. Over time you can earn it back. It is important to stay on top of fulfillment and disable SFP during times you aren’t able to process orders with a zero-day handling time.&nbsp;</p><p class=""><br></p><h1>Set Prime Order Volume</h1><p class="">You can set a limit for how many orders on a listing will be fulfilled as SFP. To do this go to the ‘General Shipping Settings’ page and select ‘Control Prime Order Volume’. There will be a blank space to set a daily limit.&nbsp;</p><p class="">Setting a Prime order limit per shipping day will take effect on the next business day. It is based on the expected shipping day - orders placed over the weekends will count as the Monday limit. Once the limit has been met the prime badge will be disabled on the listings for the remainder of the day and restored at the cut off time which is the end of the shipping day 2 PM Local Time and this only applies to same-day, two-day and next-day prime orders, not standard shipping orders.&nbsp;</p><p class=""><br></p><h1>Enable and Disable SFP</h1><p class="">You can also turn SFP on and off from the Control Prime Order Volume page with the on/off toggle.

<p class="">The biggest online shopping event of the year has been postponed yet again. Amazon’s Prime Day is typically mid-July, but COVID caused a push back to mid-September. And now we’ve just learned that the it’s getting pushed again to the week of October 5th.</p><h2>What does this mean for you?</h2><p class="">Well, first off, Q4 is going to be bananas B-A-N-A-N-A-S. So get your supply chain ready. Prime Day is in October, then Black Friday &amp; Cyber Monday in November will likely be MUCH bigger online this year due to COVID crowd restrictions for in-store shopping. And then there’s December which is just an all-out shopping frenzy every year.</p><p class="">Whew!</p><p class="">We’re teaming up with Learn From the Pros to share some specific insights on how to prepare for Prime Day.

<p class="">We’re halfway through the year and already 2020 has had more plot twists than most blockbuster movies. And one of the ramifications of this strange year is that Amazon has postponed their annual Prime Day event to September. While the date hasn’t officially been announced, the rumor is that Tuesday, September 22nd will be the big day. (UPDATE: Amazon just postponed again to the week of Oct 5th!)</p><p class="">If you’ve been selling on Amazon for awhile, you know that Amazon doesn’t release Prime Day specifics until much closer to the actual event.

<p class="">Deciding what products to offer on Amazon can be difficult when you’re competing with thousands of other brands who are also trying to provide value to their customers and ultimately win the Buy Box. There are many strategies to use that give you a competitive edge and one of them is creating product bundles on Amazon.</p><p class="">Bundles are a one-stop shopping solution that saves customers time and money. You can create a bundle by combining different products that complement each other. Creating a well-designed bundle will set your brand and products apart from the competition and provide value and convenience to Amazon customers.&nbsp;</p><h1>What is a Bundle?&nbsp;</h1><p class="">According to Amazon, “bundles must consist of products that, when packaged together, enhance or ease the overall customer experience.” That means the items in a bundle must make sense together and be items that customers are likely to purchase at the same time. For example, you could bundle a yoga mat, resistance bands, a yoga block, and a medicine ball. These are products that are relevant to one another and provide an easy shopping experience for your customers.&nbsp;<br><br></p>

<h1>What isn’t Considered a Bundle?&nbsp;</h1><p class="">Asking the question of “What is an Amazon bundle?” might seem like an obvious answer but many sellers confuse bundles and multipacks and end up getting in trouble with Amazon. A multipack includes several of the same product or versions of a product with the same SKU. For example, selling 10 yoga mats (whether they are the same color or different colors) would be a multi-pack, not a bundle.&nbsp;</p>

<h1>Why Bundle?&nbsp;</h1><p class="">There are many reasons why offering bundles are a great option for your Amazon store.&nbsp;</p><h2>Own the Buy Box&nbsp;</h2><p class="">Brands are constantly fighting to keep the Buy Box on their product listings. Offering unique bundles on Amazon essentially guarantees your spot in the buy box because you are the only seller that offers that specific set of products. In order for any other seller to sell on your bundle listing, they would have to offer all of the same items and packaging as you.</p><h2>Clear Out Slower Moving Inventory&nbsp;</h2><p class="">If you have a product or product variation that isn’t popular on its own you can add it to a bundle to clear out the inventory. For example, if you have a listing for barbell pads and they aren’t flying off the shelves as you expected, you could add it to a bundle with more popularly purchased products such as resistance bands and ankle straps.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<h2>Sell Lower Priced Items&nbsp;</h2><p class="">If you have ever sold low priced items through Amazon FBA or used a profit and loss calculator to determine the viability of offering low priced products then you probably know that it doesn’t make financial sense. Most FBA fees are fixed and come out of your selling price whether the product $5 or $50.</p><p class="">Bundles are a great way to package up several lower-priced items and actually turn a profit. The FBA fee is only deducted from one item (your bundle) instead of each individual item, you will be able to make higher margins.</p><h2>Gift-ability&nbsp;</h2><p class="">Product bundles make great gift options for Amazon shoppers. Gift sets are popular items on Amazon, as you can see by the search volume for gift-related keywords. Popular search terms include “gifts for her,” “Father’s Day gifts,” “gifts for mom,” “Christmas gifts for men,” and more! You can cash in on these keywords by creating bundles that are perfectly giftable.</p>

The identifier of any individual product in the bundle may not serve as the identifier for the bundle.

<p class="">The “Frequently bought together” tool on Amazon is designed to give customers ideas of other products that work well with the product they are currently viewing and provides them a simple way to “add all to cart.” For example, if a seller wants to list a yoga mat they can use this tool to see that customers often purchase resistance bands and foam rollers when they buy a yoga mat on Amazon.&nbsp;</p><p class="">If you are interested in creating product bundles you can use this tool to learn about customer’s buying habits to create bundles that will provide added value for customers and higher profit margins for your brand.&nbsp;</p><p class="">As most Amazon sellers know, it can be difficult to create unique products that appeal to shoppers and have great profit margins. Product bundles are the perfect solution to clearing out slow-moving inventory, winning the Buy Box, making a profit on low priced products, and creating added value for your customers!&nbsp;</p><p class=""><a href="https://www.elevategrowthgroup.com/contact">Contact us </a>today if you are ready to get ahead of your competition and start creating Amazon product bundles that will move more products and increase your sales!</p>]]></content:encoded><media:content type="image/png" url="https://images.squarespace-cdn.com/content/v1/5ce1bdd676dcc3000111bd0a/1591390562172-JIUNE7IKW8XJQMZCSC9D/ke17ZwdGBToddI8pDm48kFN-DFK1eK1PdvHSeEQ1GP0UqsxRUqqbr1mOJYKfIPR7LoDQ9mXPOjoJoqy81S2I8N_N4V1vUb5AoIIIbLZhVYxCRW4BPu10St3TBAUQYVKcMjTBaMDyDtF-PZ6G0utiW5P6KPxcFyIcI8wqAQSp9vX3A5KcwvKKTYWvQrEWfIO1/To+Bundle+or+Not+to+Bundle.png?format=1500w" medium="image" isDefault="true" width="1200" height="628"><media:title type="plain">To Bundle or Not to Bundle</media:title></media:content></item><item><title>Finding Great Products for Amazon that are Already in your Category</title><dc:creator>Jeff Wilcox</dc:creator><pubDate>Tue, 09 Jun 2020 17:00:00 +0000</pubDate><link>https://www.elevategrowthgroup.com/blog/finding-great-products-for-amazon-that-are-already-in-your-category</link><guid isPermaLink="false">5ce1bdd676dcc3000111bd0a:5d1bb1c94942c60001babb81:5ed6bdf3160e39066d219214</guid><description><![CDATA[A few years ago when Emily and I had been running Fayfaire Clothing Co

Maybe even 110% sure.</p><p class="">How, you might ask? Well, we actually used Amazon customers to find the new product for us. Or better put, our customers were screaming at us to launch this new product and we might have missed it - IF - it wasn’t for one simple thing.</p><p class="">Sponsored products advertising reports. BOOM! I know, so sexy.

&nbsp;<p class="">Before I get to the trend, let me explain in greater detail. You see, at the time Amazon only allowed us to have two types of ads. Automatic, which consisted of Amazon looking at the content of our listing and then using their best guess (via AI) to decide when to show our product to customers based on the search term they entered. Manual, which consisted of us “manually” entering the terms that we thought customers would use in the search bar and ultimately lead them to buy our product, if we paid to have it placed in front of them.</p><p class="">No, with Automatic, a lot of times Amazon simply gets it wrong. So, a common practice back then was to scour through these ad reports weekly and prune out the keywords that aren’t converting. For example, if your product was a hair tie and Amazon kept showing it in searches related to “neck ties”, then you could add the term “neck ties” and all its variations as negative keywords so your product will no longer be advertised in these searches.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p class="">As you can see in the image above, the product in question was a black two-year old birthday shirt with gold foil printing. When we launched this, our thought was that black would be unisex and that it would be purchased for both boys and girls...and it was...sort of!</p><p class="">Even though we knew that it was being purchased for BOTH Boys and girls based on what we were seeing in hash-tagged posts on social media, the Automatic ad reports were telling a different story. While some people were happy buying a black shirt for both boys and girls, there was definitely a large segment of people who preferred a different color palette for girls.</p><p class="">When taking a closer look at the data, we noticed that for terms like “boys first birthday shirt”, “first bday shirt for boys”, etc; our conversion rate was well within our acceptable parameters to continue paying for these terms for the black shirts. However, when we looked at the data for the same search terms with “boys” replaced with “girls” - we were hemorrhaging money. In other words, lots of people were clicking on our ads for girls and NOT purchasing.&nbsp;</p><p class="">We took this to mean that they wanted another color option. Fast forward a few weeks and we unleashed what would soon be one of our top sellers and go on to outpace the sale of our black version 3 to 1 in no time! </p>&nbsp;

<p class="">Inventory management has been an essential part of business long before the days of Amazon, only to evolve through different mediums of retail and e-commerce. The age-old practice of forecasting (or fortune-telling as it should really be called) when it comes to product demand still boils down to the same question: “How do we maintain enough inventory to stay in stock, while avoiding the liability of having excess?”</p><h2>The Amazon Inventory Dilemma</h2><p class="">So what makes inventory management on Amazon a much higher risk compared to traditional e-commerce platforms?&nbsp;</p><p class="">The most important thing to understand about Amazon is that their product is not a physical item whatsoever, the product that Amazon.com is selling is a <em>curated customer experience. </em>In order to provide this customer experience, sellers are rewarded when they follow marketplace guidelines and utilize Amazon’s selling features, but are sometimes harshly reprimanded when they don’t - especially when it damages the customer experience. When a customer comes to purchase or repurchase a product and it is out of stock, not only does this provide a poor experience for the customer, but they are then forced to search <em>off </em>Amazon to purchase the desired item. Bad for you as a seller, and more importantly, bad for Amazon.&nbsp;</p><p class="">The way Amazon handles this situation is by leveraging their algorithm in relation to your product’s BSR (Base Sellers Rank). Because you have gone out of stock and effectively disproved your credibility with Amazon, your BSR can take a substantial negative hit. So not only are you going to lose sales while you are out of stock, but once you replenish your inventory, you are less likely to sell at the rate you previously had. Pair this with a competitor who is eager to take your place in the market and it can have an exponential impact on sales.&nbsp;</p><p class="">Assuming you are utilizing Amazon FBA (Amazon Prime provides the best customer experience), the simple solution would just be to send in as much inventory as you can to ensure you never go out of stock, however, this will of course incur costly monthly storage fees, long-term storage fees if it takes longer than 12 months to sell, and removal fees if you ever want to remove the product from the FBA warehouse.&nbsp;</p><h2>The Sweet Spot</h2><p class="">Now that we know the risks of having too little inventory and the costs of having too much, how do we determine the optimal amount when sending inventory into Amazon FBA?&nbsp;</p><p class=""><strong>In order to find our sweet spot, there are a few things we need to know:</strong></p><h3><strong>1. Lead Times</strong></h3><p class="">If you were to run out of stock today, how many days would it take you to have inventory back in the FBA warehouse, ready for sale?</p><p class="">Don’t forget to take into account that you may first be put into a queue with your manufacturer before your product starts getting made, inspected, shipped, cleared through customs, and delivered to the FBA warehouse. It will then take anywhere from 3-5 days for Amazon’s employees to scan your items and make them available, but always plan for a little more time.&nbsp;</p><h3>2. Historical Sales Data</h3><p class="">What have your average daily sales been in the last 30-90 days? Is it trending up or down?&nbsp;</p><p class="">If you have a new-to-market product, using 3rd party software to estimate competitor sales may be the best data you can find. It will be a lot more guesswork, but if you have done proper market research before deciding to launch this product on Amazon you should have a sense of where you fall in the market. Just keep in mind that competitors already have sales and review history, while you don’t.&nbsp;</p><h3>3.Seasonal Trends</h3><p class="">Are there seasonal trends that you need to account for? This includes high volume days like Prime Day or Black Friday/Cyber Monday, even potential marketing campaigns that you may be preparing for externally.&nbsp;</p><p class="">As with the average daily sales, if you have a new product it will be worth researching the historical sales data of competitors. Many 3rd party softwares will show competitors’ last 30-day sales volumes, and a historical chart for BSR. Utilize these tools to gauge how much additional traffic might be coming in for the products in your market during different times of the year.&nbsp;</p><h2>The Formula</h2><p class="">Once you have an understanding of these things, you can use the following formula to understand the <strong>bare minimum </strong>for your inventory levels:</p><p class="">(Average Daily Sales x Lead Time) + Seasonal Forecast + Buffer = Minimum Inventory Level</p><p class=""><strong>For example:<br></strong><em>100 (Ave. Daily Sales) x 30 (Lead Time in # of days) + 50% or 1500 units (last season showed 50% increase during upcoming season, so I can expect similar this season) + Buffer = 4500 units + Buffer</em></p><p class="">Using this formula you can generally assume that if your inventory levels have fallen below this amount, you can expect to go out of stock before your replenishment becomes available for sale again.&nbsp;</p><p class="">The “buffer” is determined by your financial restraints and gut feeling. If it's a new product and you aren’t sure how it will perform, or you are tight on cash, the buffer might be closer to 2-3 weeks so you can assess your average daily sales within that time before making a replenishment order. On the other hand, sometimes it is worth spending a little more on storage fees to mitigate the risk of going out of stock.&nbsp;</p><p class="">A general rule that is often used, is replenishing to a 90-120 day supply. This is often going to give you enough runway for aggressive sales and advertising without as much risk of incurring long-term storage fees or removals if something goes wrong on your seller account or listing. If you currently have a 60-day supply in the warehouse, you would want to replenish another 60-90 day supply (accounting for the 30-day lead time before the replenishment order arrives). As long as you don’t let your inventory sink below the minimum levels, being subject to the harsh reprimand of Amazon’s algorithm shouldn’t be a concern of yours any longer.&nbsp;</p>]]></content:encoded><media:content type="image/jpeg" url="https://images.squarespace-cdn.com/content/v1/5ce1bdd676dcc3000111bd0a/1591128296843-4XI5JHDXSPKROBTCHHAE/ke17ZwdGBToddI8pDm48kDLlXMdP242kzA3MzQvPmxwUqsxRUqqbr1mOJYKfIPR7LoDQ9mXPOjoJoqy81S2I8N_N4V1vUb5AoIIIbLZhVYxCRW4BPu10St3TBAUQYVKcmr04PHhfprLQSoJ_G7DArtrVg7mjhjU0b9TSi1r1sZCMqpGcBvUwd4_w4Ab2UcwP/amazon-inventory.jpg?format=1500w" medium="image" isDefault="true" width="1080" height="400"><media:title type="plain">How Much is Too Much? - Amazon Inventory Management in 2020</media:title></media:content></item><item><title>Making Lemonade Out Of Negative Reviews</title><dc:creator>Nicole Schafer</dc:creator><pubDate>Thu, 14 May 2020 18:57:00 +0000</pubDate><link>https://www.elevategrowthgroup.com/blog/making-lemonade-out-of-negative-reviews</link><guid isPermaLink="false">5ce1bdd676dcc3000111bd0a:5d1bb1c94942c60001babb81:5ed668e889accd53aa20d113</guid><description><![CDATA[Amazon sellers have a love-hate relationship with their product reviews.

<p class="">Amazon sellers have a love-hate relationship with their product reviews. Positive reviews are the lifeblood of a product page, promoting the product and positively influencing buying decisions. Negative reviews, unfortunately, can lead directly to a drop in sales, along with a lower visual star count that can be tough to bounce back from. As a seller, you naturally want to avoid this and wonder: what can I do?&nbsp;</p><p class="">First and foremost, <strong>DON’T PANIC.</strong> While seeing a negative review pop up on your listing can feel heart-stopping, make sure you take a breath before you start rage-texting via the comment box. Instead, flip your thought process and remind yourself that product reviews are feedback directly from your target market: your buyers. If you use them right, negative reviews can be a launching pad to make your product easier to use, your listing more clear, and the buyer experience better overall.&nbsp;</p><p class="">While we don’t suggest that you take every single negative review literally (maybe the reviewer was just having a bad day), we do strongly suggest you look for repeat patterns within your reviews. Are multiple buyers saying the size runs small? Maybe you could add a size chart to your listing. Are two buyers both saying they received a blue one when they ordered yellow? Maybe you’ve got some inventory mix-up you need to sort out. If you use a negative review to fix an issue and prevent it from happening to a future buyer, you’ll save yourself time, money, and a giant headache down the road.&nbsp;</p><p class="">Regardless of how helpful you consider a buyer’s negative product review, always make sure they are <strong>PLAYING BY THE RULES</strong> - Amazon’s rules, I should say. Amazon’s <a href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/help/customer/display.html?nodeId=GLHXEX85MENUE4XF"><span>Community Guidelines</span></a> have a pretty clear “don’t be a jerk” tone, meaning that while a buyer is encouraged to share their truthful experience with your product, Amazon draws the line with things like harassment, profanity, or false content. Instead, they encourage product reviews to be helpful, relevant, and respectful.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p class="">As an Amazon seller, you should familiarize yourself with the Community Guidelines because even if a negative product review is true, if they violate Amazon’s Community Guidelines you may be able to get it removed. It’s not a guarantee, but it’s always worth a try. If you think a product review violates Amazon’s Community Guidelines, you can click the "Report abuse" link under the review or email <a href="mailto:community-help@amazon.com"><span>community-help@amazon.com</span></a> with the details.&nbsp;</p><p class="">If the negative review doesn’t end up being a rule-breaker and is here to stay on your listing, get in the habit of <strong>SEARCHING FOR CLUES</strong> within the review. Your goal should be to match the negative review with one of your buyer’s contact details so you can attempt to connect with them and offer a fix (generally a refund or replacement, depending on your product).&nbsp;</p><p class="">The product reviews offer us quite a few opportunities for clues to match with a buyer. First, the product review is already connected to a specific ASIN, so if you sell multiple products, you can begin your search by filtering for buyers of that specific ASIN only. Make sure you take a look at the name of the reviewer (which is not necessarily the same name of the buyer on their account, by the way). If they’ve reviewed your product with what seems like a legit first and/or last name, you may have hit the jackpot. Otherwise, get creative with your buyer search based on what could be a nickname or initials. You can also sometimes score the reviewer’s location if you click on their name and they’ve shared that on their profile.&nbsp;</p><p class="">Other major clues can be left for you within their review itself. For example, if they say something like “I bought this for the first time in February and loved it, but this one is too loud”, you’ll know you are looking for a repeat customer. If their review offers a product description such as “The green color in the listing looks very different from what I received”, you’ll know you can search for green product buyers only.&nbsp;</p><p class="">One other thing to note: Amazon allows buyers to review your product even if they have never purchased it. If you notice that “Verified Purchase” is missing from the product review page, it’s likely going to be difficult (ok, impossible) to match that review with one of your buyers, since they probably haven’t actually purchased from you at all.&nbsp;</p><p class="">Trying to match a reviewer with a buyer can sometimes feel like a needle in a haystack, but if you make the connection, you’ve got a chance of turning that buyer’s experience around (and hopefully turning that negative review into a positive one, too).</p><p class="">We all know what happens when we assume...and none of us want to look like an ass. So when it comes to negative product reviews, if you want to assume something, make sure you <strong>ASSUME THE BEST</strong> of your buyer. That means if they tell you their product never arrived, believe them. If they say they only received one but they ordered two, trust them. We’ve found that a majority of buyers are, in fact, telling the truth and not out to scam you.&nbsp;</p><p class="">We know that can be easier said than done. It’s not always easy to take a complaint - aka a negative product review - and turn it into lemonade, especially when the complaint is something you know isn’t or can’t be true. But trust us when we tell you it isn’t worth arguing with a buyer because you almost certainly won’t win. And by ‘win’ we mean flip the review to 5-stars or get a repeat customer out of the situation. Instead, as you pay (again) for that shipping even though it already shows ‘delivered’, think of it as a small investment that will hopefully result in big rewards!</p>]]></content:encoded><media:content type="image/png" url="https://images.squarespace-cdn.com/content/v1/5ce1bdd676dcc3000111bd0a/1591127994735-RF1KCR1TSM8EPLDG0O1A/ke17ZwdGBToddI8pDm48kHAKWkOFLOz437-FJ_CSk0xZw-zPPgdn4jUwVcJE1ZvWQUxwkmyExglNqGp0IvTJZamWLI2zvYWH8K3-s_4yszcp2ryTI0HqTOaaUohrI8PIKm49qJvmmBJ9sWX5wYi-GzFDxe97NbB8Vc18G6fOm8Q/1_5VOicbQs78iXZrztJmRTLA.png?format=1500w" medium="image" isDefault="true" width="814" height="466"><media:title type="plain">Making Lemonade Out Of Negative Reviews</media:title></media:content></item><item><title>What is a good ACoS?</title><dc:creator>Emily Wilcox</dc:creator><pubDate>Sat, 02 May 2020 20:06:00 +0000</pubDate><link>https://www.elevategrowthgroup.com/blog/what-is-a-good-acos</link><guid isPermaLink="false">5ce1bdd676dcc3000111bd0a:5d1bb1c94942c60001babb81:5ed6b1491e04677c30196705</guid><description><![CDATA[Ten times out of ten I get asked this question when I’m talking to new and

They want to know if their current ACoS is “good” or “bad” and what the target should be.</p><p class="">That said, there’s only one correct response: “What’s your goal for Amazon advertising?”</p><p class="">If you don’t understand the goal behind the action, how can we possibly label it as “good” or “bad”?&nbsp;</p><p class=""><strong>Goals for Amazon Advertising might include:</strong></p><ul data-rte-list="default"><li><p class="">Increased organic ranking</p></li><li><p class="">Rapid customer acquisition</p></li><li><p class="">Incremental, profitable sales</p></li><li><p class="">Scaling gross revenue</p></li><li><p class="">Offensive positioning against a competitor</p></li><li><p class="">Brand defense</p></li></ul><p class="">We onboarded a client that had a 1% lifetime ACoS. Yes, you read that right, <em>one percent</em>. Meaning, they were spending $0.01 to make a dollar. That sounds freaking fantastic! Buuuuut (could you sense there was a ‘but’?), they wanted to scale their gross revenue. They were stuck at $20,000 per month. When we dug into their advertising data, they were only bidding on their own branded keywords (i.e. their own brand name.) Since their brand name doesn’t get searched that much on Amazon, this strategy had hit its ceiling. Thus, their 1% ACoS was “bad”, because it wasn’t helping them to accomplish their goal of scaling gross revenue. They needed to broaden their bidding strategy and accept a higher ACoS in order to grow.</p><p class="">Conversely, there’s a nutrition bar company that you’ve seen in every store &amp; gas station and have probably tried yourself (you’d know the name if I said it.) Their ACoS was over 100%, meaning they <em>lost money</em> on their Amazon advertising. Was that “bad”? Well, their goal was customer acquisition. You see, they didn’t care if they lost money to get you to try their bars, because they felt confident that they would make it back over your lifetime as a customer with them. And they recently sold for a billion dollars.&nbsp;</p><p class="">So a 1% ACoS can be bad.<br>And a 100+% ACoS can be good.<br>And everything in between.&nbsp;</p><p class="">The only thing that’s black &amp; white BAD is if you’re spending money on Amazon Advertising and you don’t know why you’re doing it. Defining your goal is the first step toward leveraging the power of Amazon ads.</p><p class="">If you need help defining your goal, or want to talk through the Amazon strategy that makes the most sense for your brand, send us a message and we’ll get you scheduled for a complimentary Amazon Strategy Session.</p>]]></content:encoded><media:content type="image/png" url="https://images.squarespace-cdn.com/content/v1/5ce1bdd676dcc3000111bd0a/1591128568972-P2TNJ9H5L3W5UWIYYLXD/ke17ZwdGBToddI8pDm48kDqakWtqmPm4vCoK1lRFStYUqsxRUqqbr1mOJYKfIPR7LoDQ9mXPOjoJoqy81S2I8N_N4V1vUb5AoIIIbLZhVYxCRW4BPu10St3TBAUQYVKcwbBrmv3mGSbNRnDWDhY9vp6y1A-m8pDeJ49P90LzDhW4KOSQ-J3aajJ1It96bLMX/What-is-a-Good-Amazon-ACOS-And-Why-Lower-Isn%E2%80%99t-Always-Better.png?format=1500w" medium="image" isDefault="true" width="1200" height="617"><media:title type="plain">What is a good ACoS?</media:title></media:content></item><item><title>Video ...

We’ve seen the shift to video format dominate other industries. Print market share has started to erode, Facebook’s image and posts have been edged out due to increasing video placement within feeds. Everyday there are more than 4 billion video views on facebook alone. All of this hype isn’t even including the other viral platforms that pop up and are catered to by advertisers from old school (in a relative sense) Snapchat, Instagram to new upstarts like Tik Tok. People are consuming content at all time highs as of late thanks to video.</p><p class="">So where exactly does Amazon fit in in the video conversation? We just want to pop on the phone, click the little blue shopping cart icon and have our Nerf Gun gift wrapped and delivered next day. While that may be the case for a large amount of purchases, there are many more out there where static images and lifestyle shots just don’t display enough to move us to the purchasing phase. We often talk about going into stores and looking the product up on Amazon to see if it’s cheaper and buying it there, but what about the opposite. How many times have you seen a product on Amazon, and gone to a store instead because you weren’t exactly sure if it’s what you were looking for? Whether this is the specific use case or just an evolution of the marketplace we’ve seen Amazon more and more start to embrace video content as of late.</p><p class="">Recently Amazon made available to select advertisers the ability to upload short video segments into their Sponsored Brands ads placement. Coupling this with listing videos in image placements, video for related products or Amazon live we’ve seen a huge push for video related content onto the platform.&nbsp;</p><p class="">With the Sponsored Brands Video Ads, sellers can now select a single product and upload a video short highlighting specific features they previously would have had to rely on lifestyle images or detail page copy to highlight. Additionally, videos can help to cut down on returns and negative reviews. If you have the ability to accurately portray how your product is used you can highlight issues that often arise and help mitigate those pre purchase.</p><p class="">So, where exactly does video content appear on Amazon? We’ve got three prominent placements, and a hidden fourth.</p><h2>Product Listings:</h2><p class="">For starters we have the video placement which is contained within images. You can upload directly to the listing replacing an image slot so when customers click on your listing and are scrolling through images your video can be played. </p>

<h2>Product Listing Related Uploads:</h2><p class="">The one unknown and often underutilized video placement. You can actually upload a video directly to your listing by utilizing the “Upload your video” link. There are certain rules and limitations to this surrounding the amount of videos you can post and what will appear, but it’s always a good idea to add any additional video content to your listing if not to help sell the product but defend space from other videos on the listing as well.</p>

If you aren’t familiar with the differences, it can be overwhelming choosing the fulfillment option that is best for you and your brand.</p><p class="">First, you’ll need to know the differences between Amazon Vendor Central or Amazon Seller Central. The main difference between these two options is who actually sells your products. Amazon will buy your products from you, then resell them to their customers, with Vendor Central. If you choose Seller Central, you will sell your products directly to customers, through the Amazon marketplace.&nbsp;</p><p class="">Continue reading for an overview of Vendor Central and Seller Central and what each offers.&nbsp;</p><h2>Seller Central</h2><p class="">Amazon Seller Central is used by merchants to market and sell products directly to customers within the Amazon marketplace.

The fourth quarter is the home for a number of holidays that can help third-party Amazon sellers meet their end of year goals!&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p class="">We want to make sure you are prepared for the upcoming holiday season. Read below for tips on preparing for the holiday season on Amazon. We will discuss managing inventory, pricing, optimizing your product description page, and of course, review the important dates in Q4.&nbsp;</p><h2>Inventory</h2><p class="">Be proactive with your inventory in Q4. Figure out which products will need to be restocked and plan for an increase in sales compared to previous quarters (meaning you will need more inventory than usual). Have your inventory ready to be shipped to the fulfillment centers in October. Be aware of FBA intake processing delays and supplier/carrier lead times, as it may take longer to fulfill inventory during the busy season. Most importantly DO NOT run out of inventory during the holidays because it could cost you thousands in lost sales!</p>

<p class="">You should also be conscious of the overstock on products that aren’t moving. In 2019 Amazon increased its<a href="https://sellercentral.amazon.com/gp/help/help.html?itemID=7DQBYCMB6KE58SG&amp;language=en_US&amp;ref=ag_7DQBYCMB6KE58SG_relt_200141420"> storage fees</a> for FBA sellers. Between October – December standard size will cost $2.40 per cubic foot and oversize will cost $1.20 per cubic foot. Don’t waste your budget on storing products that won’t move.&nbsp;</p><p class="">Clear out your slow-moving stock that is taking up room on the Amazon shelves by cutting prices, running promotions, creating new bundles, or donating products to charity for a tax write off. Moving these products will save you money on storage fees and increase your Best Sellers Rank (BSR), helping you get your products closer to page 1.</p><h2>Pricing</h2><p class="">In addition to price reductions on slow-moving products, you should also take a look at the current pricing for all of your products. The Amazon algorithm loves low prices (as do Amazon shoppers). If you’re priced 15% less than the best sellers on page 1 for a keyword, Amazon will start moving you up the rankings quickly.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="">&nbsp;Don’t worry, your prices won’t need to stay low forever. We use a strategy that slowly raises the price back to the full price as the sales velocity picks up. This is done in small increments to maintain the Buy Box. This strategy can improve your Click Through Rate (CTR) on your advertising, increase your organic sales, and improve your rankings across all indexed keywords (which will result in MORE SALES)!&nbsp;</p><h2>Listing Health</h2><p class="">Q4 is the most competitive quarter for Amazon sellers. It is time to make sure your listings are visually appealing and fully optimized with images, copy and Enhanced Brand Content (if available).&nbsp; Here are a few guidelines for an attractive listing that will increase your conversion rates this quarter.</p>

<h2>Copy</h2><p class="">Your listings should have optimized bullet points, titles, and detailed product descriptions that use relevant high-ranking keywords. Use a keyword research tool to determine the most effective key terms for your product. Then input as many as possible in the copy to increase your listings visibility, relevance, and conversion. Adding SEO optimized copy will give you an edge over your competitors.</p><h2>Images</h2><p class="">You should have 5-6 secondary images that include text, banners, and lifestyle imagery. Display images that show your product in use and call out the benefits not just the features of your product. For example, a product feature might be 100% natural coconut oil. The benefit of this feature for your customers is “soft moisturized skin that will make you feel beautiful.”</p><h2>Enhanced Brant Content</h2><p class="">Enhanced Brand Content (EBC) will set your Amazon listing apart from competitors and help you build your companies brand. It will make your listing more visually appealing to shoppers by allowing you to add more images to convey the benefits of your product and tell the story of your brand. EBC is<a href="https://cpcstrategy.com/blog/2018/05/amazon-enhanced-brand-content-examples/"> proven to increase </a>conversion and click-through rates.</p><h2>Holiday Optimizations&nbsp;</h2><p class="">Aside from a general health check on the copy and images in your listings, we also suggest a few minor changes that are specific to the holidays. You should update your copy with relevant holiday keywords such as, “stocking stuffers for kids,” “Christmas gifts for mom,” and “Christmas gifts for husband.”</p><p class="">This serves two purposes; it will catch the eye of the consumer and help your product rank for holiday-related search terms. You can also add holiday-themed images to your priority listings to communicate that your product is perfect for gift giving!</p><h2>Know Key Dates</h2><p class="">Last but certainly not least, you need to know all of the important Amazon dates and deadlines, so you don’t miss out on any opportunities to increase your sales in Q4. Amazon hasn’t shared cutoff dates for 2019 yet; however, we can assume they will be similar to the dates <a href="https://sellercentral.amazon.com/gp/help/help.html?itemID=G201637520&amp;language=en_US">shared in 2018 </a>(which are shown below for reference).</p><ul data-rte-list="default"><li><p class="">Oct 31: Halloween</p></li><li><p class="">Nov 5: <strong>Inventory for Black Friday and Cyber Monday</strong> should arrive at Amazon fulfillment centers by this day.</p></li><li><p class="">Nov 28: Thanksgiving</p></li><li><p class="">Nov 29: Black Friday</p></li><li><p class="">Dec 2: Cyber Monday</p></li><li><p class="">Dec 5: <strong>Inventory for Christmas shopping</strong> should arrive at Amazon fulfillment centers by this day<strong>.</strong></p></li></ul>

<p class="">It’s time to act fast, because Black Friday &amp; Cyber Monday preparations are in full swing. If you’re an Amazon Seller or Amazon Vendor, you need to take 3 action steps to get ready.</p><h2><strong>1. Grab any and all available deals for Black Friday Week and Cyber Monday week (This action step is TIME SENSITIVE and should be done immediately!)</strong></h2><p class="">Amazon released deals for BF Week and CM Week yesterday (8/28/19) and they won’t last long. We recommend grabbing every single deal Amazon offers you. As the dates get closer, you’ll be assigned an exact date &amp; time for your Lightning Deal…and that is the true decision point. Timing is everything, and if you’re offered a deal on a bad date &amp; time, then you can cancel without any penalty. You can also adjust inventory levels and discount percentages up to 24 hours before the deal goes live.</p><p class="">The bottom line: right now it’s just a land grab. Sign up for every deal and then decide later if you want to run it or cancel it.</p><p class="">For Amazon Sellers: Go to Advertising &gt;&gt; Deals &gt;&gt; Create a New Deal</p><p class="">For Amazon Vendors: Go to Merchandising &gt;&gt; Promotions &gt;&gt; Start a New Campaign</p>

<h2><strong>2. Forecast your inventory needs.</strong></h2><p class="">Going ‘Out of Stock’ is one of the worst things that can happen on Amazon. Not only do you miss out on sales while you’re out of stock, but your product will also lose ground on keyword ranking which has a lasting impact for weeks and sometimes months, even once your product is back in stock.</p><p class="">It is generally accepted that <strong>most sellers will experience a 3-5x sales multiple during Q4.</strong> Most of this lift will take place during the four weeks between Black Friday and Dec 21st. Be prepared. Have LOTS of inventory available. This will allow you the enjoy the holiday season as you watch your sales climb, instead of stressing about going out of stock and missing sales. <strong><em>For bestselling products that have a wide audience and are especially giftable, expect even bigger sales multiples</em></strong><em>.</em></p>
